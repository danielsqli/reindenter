This is an app that will reindent code blocks

## Current Options

Can set to use either tabs or spaces, and how many to use per indent

## Features
Will remove excess indents, and add them when necessary.

## Requirements

The app assumes that the language used uses [`{}`] to separate code, and that extra whitespace is ignored
